🎯 **About Me**

I'm a full-stack developer with 4+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and high-performance web/mobile applications. I specialize in React, Next.js, NestJS, Docker, and system architecture — with a strong focus on clean code, product thinking, and measurable impact.

I thrive in environments that demand precision, speed, and security — especially in fintech and edtech. My mindset is detail-oriented, product-driven, and collaborative. I enjoy mentoring, standardizing workflows, and building systems that scale.
