🎯 **About Me**

I'm a frontend developer with 4+ years of experience building high-performance web and mobile applications, especially in banking-grade environments that demand security, scalability, and precision. I specialize in ReactJS, Micro-Frontend architecture, DevOps, and performance optimization — with a mindset focused on clean design, measurable impact, and long-term maintainability.

I believe great products are not just functional, but elegant. My working style is meticulous, detail-oriented, and driven by a philosophy of continuous improvement. I enjoy mentoring, standardizing components, and refining workflows to help teams deliver faster and smarter.
